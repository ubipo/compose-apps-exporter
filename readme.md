# Compose Apps Exporter üê≥üì§üî•

Prometheus exporter for docker compose apps

On every scrape, the exporter will read all [docker compose files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/) in the given
paths and, for every service of every app, will export the following metrics:
- `compose_service_up{compose_app="my-app", compose_service="my-service"}`  
(1 if the service status is 'Up', 0 otherwise)
- `compose_service_health{compose_app="my-app", compose_service="my-service"}`  
(1 if the service health is 'healthy', 0 otherwise)

Both of these metrics will have a value of `1` if the service is up and healthy,
and `0` otherwise.

Additionally, the exporter will export a `compose_apps_nbro_configs` metric with
the number of compose files it has read.

The exporter relies on [docker compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/), and so requires the compose configs to
be in file format V2 or V3.

## Usage

### Executable

```bash
compose-apps-exporter
```

...or with custom configuration:

```bash
compose-apps-exporter \
  --port 9200 \
  --address "127.24.0.1" \
  --compose-configs-glob "/etc/my-own-path-to-compose-apps/**/non-standard.yaml"
```

By default, the exporter only listens on `127.0.0.1`. To listen on all
interfaces, use the `--address 0.0.0.0` or `-a 0.0.0.0` flag, or set the
`COMPOSE_APPS_EXPORTER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` environment variable.

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 9179:9179 \
  -v /run/docker.sock:/run/docker.sock:rw \
  -v /path/to/compose/apps:/etc/compose-apps:ro \
  --name compose-apps-exporter \
  pfiers/compose-apps-exporter
```

In docker, the exporter listens on all interfaces by default.

## Configuration

From lowest to highest priority, configuration is loaded from:
  - Default values
  - User configuration file (OS specific, see '-h' for details)
  - System configuration file (OS specific, see '-h' for details, `/etc/compose-apps-exporter/config.yaml` on Linux)
  - Environment variables (prefixed with 'COMPOSE_APPS_EXPORTER_')
  - Command line arguments

### Configuration File Format

```yaml
compose_configs_glob:
  - "/etc/my-own-path-to-compose-apps/**/non-standard.yaml"
port: 8854
address: "127.24.0.1"
```
